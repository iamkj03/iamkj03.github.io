description: This project was to research on technologies used for indoor localization. Our work calculates the distance from the object and sends the data to the receiver. This can be used in a situation of natural disaster on a quadropter to search for the wounds or to show the situation where human cannot reach.

This project was to research on technologies used for indoor localization. Our work calculates the distance from the object and sends the data to the receiver. This can be used in a situation of natural disaster on a quadropter to search for the wounds or to show the situation where human cannot reach.

Our work uses ultrasonic sensor, and RF sensor to calculate the distance and to communicate each other.
