The above chart shows about the server part. Server part will create a server socket to get connected with a client. If a request from client that it wants to get connected comes, it opens to client and start connection. From this point, you can send/read messages or send files.

The JAVA code was used for the programming.

This program had messenger that allows text conversation, image transmission, and viewing the directory. Following figure is one of the image from the program sending and receiving the image.
