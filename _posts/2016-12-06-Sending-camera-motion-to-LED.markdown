This project was done during the Capstone Design.

The ojective of the project:


I saw an event video from a car company 2015 October. The event was like the following.
The company remodeled the traffic light and made it was remade to show the outline of a person dancing in a booth nearby. As a result of the event, people were waiting for the traffic lights with fun and patience and there were more than 70 percent of laywalking.

Our team wanted to do something similar to this which could provide students on campus to have fun this way. Final goal was to implement this on the traffic light as well but resource and time was limited.
