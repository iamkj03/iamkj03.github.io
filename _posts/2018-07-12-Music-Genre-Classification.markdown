It was a final project for Machine learning class.

Press [Final Paper(Not published)](Music Genre Classification via Image Classification Model.pdf) to open.

We thought the sound can be converted to an image and the image can be used as a genre (image) classification data.

[classical](classical.00083.png)

and so on..

We got the data(.au files) from [GTZAN set](http://marsyasweb.appspot.com/download/data_sets/)

[Flowchart](flowchart.jpg)
We used 3 different image classifier in Keras.

The result was as shown. (0.855 AUC)
